# Building the Standalone Executable

## For You (The Developer)

To create the standalone executable for your users:

1. **Install Node.js** (only needed once): https://nodejs.org/download/
2. **Double-click `BUILD-STANDALONE.bat`**
3. **Wait for it to finish** (may take 5-10 minutes first time)
4. **Find your executable** in the `dist` folder

## What Gets Created

Two options for your users:

### Option 1: Setup File (Recommended)
- `dist/Scholia Diaspros Deckbuilder Setup 1.0.0.exe`
- Users double-click to install
- Creates desktop shortcut
- Looks professional

### Option 2: Portable Executable  
- `dist/Scholia Diaspros Deckbuilder 1.0.0.exe`
- Users just double-click to run
- No installation needed
- Single file (~200MB)

## For Your Users

1. **Double-click the .exe file**
2. **That's it!**

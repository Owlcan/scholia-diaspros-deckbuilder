## Development Setup

### Using GitHub Codespaces (Recommended)

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - Main application file
- `TCG-cards.js` - Card database (JSON format)
- `src/assets/images/` - Card artwork
- `.devcontainer/` - Codespaces configuration
- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions

## Adding New Cards

To add new cards to the database:

1. Add card images to `src/assets/images/expeditionandgames/TCG Images/`
2. Add card data to `TCG-cards.js` following the existing format:

```javascript
{
  id: 'unique_card_id',
  name: "Card Name",
  type: "Monster Card", // or "Student Card", "Spell Card", etc.
  race: "Race Name", // optional
  tier: "Minion", // Minion, Utility, Medium, Strong, Boss, Legendary
  cost: "1 Universal", // energy cost
  hp: 2, // health points
  atk: 1, // attack points
  ability: {
    name: "Ability Name",
    description: "Ability description"
  },
  image_url: "src/assets/images/expeditionandgames/TCG Images/cardname.webp"
}
```

## Art Variants

The system automatically detects art variants:
- Base: `cardname.webp`
- Variants: `cardname (1).webp`, `cardname (2).webp`, etc.

## Code Style
